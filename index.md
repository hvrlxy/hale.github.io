# ABOUT ME

Hi! My name is Ha Le and I'm currently an undergraduate student from Gustavus Adolphus College. I'm pursuing a double major in Computer Science and Mathematics, and possibly a minor in Statistics as well. My research focus on social computing, natural language processing and human-centered machine learning.

During the summer of 2020, I was fortunate enough to work with Dr. Jacob Siehler on a solving a modified version of Conway's Soldiers problems: one dimensional port-and-sweep-solitaire army problem. After the summer, I worked under the supervision of Professor Louis Yu on studying channel popularity on Twitch. Our result paper is currently under reviewed at ADMA'21.

You can access my latest CV [here](./assets/pdfs/Grad_School_Resume.pdf)
